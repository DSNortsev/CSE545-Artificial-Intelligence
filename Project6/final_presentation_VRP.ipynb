    "# Vehicle Routing Problem ‚Äê Genetic Algorithm with Wisdom of Artificial Crowds\n",
    " \n",
    "The **vehicle routing problem** deals with minimizing the total cost of logistics systems.In transportation management, there is a requirement to provide services from a supply point (depot) to various geographically dispersed points (customers) with optimal routes. \n",

    "**Genetic Algorithm(GA)** are adaptive heuristic search algorithms that belong to the larger part of evolutionary algorithms. Genetic algorithms are based on the ideas of natural selection and genetics. Generally, GA is composed of two processes selection and manipulation of the selected individuals by crossover and mutation techniques. The first process is selection of individuals for the production of the next generation and the second process is manipulation of the selected individuals to form the next generation by crossover and mutation techniques. \n",

    "**Wisdom of Artificial Crowds (WoAC)** is a post-processing algorithm in which independently deciding artificial agents aggregate their individual solutions to arrive at an answer which is superior to all solutions present in the population.\n",
    " \n",
    "In this presentation, we will attempt to find optimal routes for **VRP** by applying  enhanced Genetic Algorithm with Wisdom of Artificial Crowds. The definitional of optimal routes is to minimize the length of the longest single route among all vehicles. The main goal of VRP  is to complete all deliveries as soon as possible. The Vehicle Routing Problem may include different constraints on the vehicle such as capacity or time windows. For example, a vehicle have a maximum carrying capacity or locations must be visited withing a specific time windows. For simplicity, we will be only considering one depot with multiple vehicles without any additional constraints. \n"
